##### Live Website: https://goofy-neumann-fd67a4.netlify.app/

### Problems faced by artists / Inspiration
#### 1. Lack of technical knowledge
- Artists have ready-designed artworks and wish to enter the NFT scene, however, existing marketplaces do not support mass uploading
- Lack technical expertise to customize and deploy their own smart contract
- As such, they miss out on opportunity to monetize and promote their creations
#### 2. Cost & risk associated with outsourcing
- Creators may not have the resources to hire dedicated developers to work on their project
- Not every developers are good actors (counterparty risk), outsourcing work fundamentally relies on trust
#### 3. Time consuming & inefficient process
- Hello world
